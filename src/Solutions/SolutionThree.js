            <p className='BodyText'>This website has so far advocated market solutions. But if you want the <span className='emphasis'>City to have a greater say</span> in what goes where, instead of using zoning, you might just advocate the <span className='emphasis'>City purchase parcels</span> in high traffic areas along the canal and ground lease them out to developers. We all understand a normal lease for a apartment, but you can also <span className='emphasis'>lease land itself</span>. If the term is long enough a developer will still construct a building and operate a business. The City does have a notorious reputation as a developer (losing millions on the Sheraton isn't a good look), but ground leasing is <span className='emphasis'>already common practice</span> by the State's Land Department. This way, the City still has say about what goes where (and might make some money in the process).<br/><br/><span className='emphasis'>Vote below</span> if you think ground leases are a good idea.</p>
