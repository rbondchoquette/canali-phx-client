          First, our canals are <span className='emphasis'>true utilities</span>, unlike like those in San Antonio or Los Angeles.
          Every other canal you might hope to inspire our city is, in a literal sense, useless. 
          Phoenix canals <span className='emphasis'>built this city</span>. 
          Amerstam's canals, on the other hand, were a defensive-moat (and <span className='emphasis'>truly disgusting</span> for 800 years).<br/><br/>
          Second, the City of <span className='emphasis'>Phoenix does not have much say</span> in how the canals are designed or run.
          The Canals are owned by the federal government, through the Bureau of Reclamation, and operated by the Salt River Project.
          That's why the best recent effort to develop the canals, the Grand Canalscape, had a skinny budget.
          Mostly federal funds, some from SRP, and pocket change from the cityâ€”designed to make the canals more usable, but still functional.
          Admittedly, the project isn't much more than concrete and a bit of desert life.
          All this said, the canal remains a testament to our government's ability to provide <span className='emphasis'>life in the desert</span>, as designed by the Hohokam.<br/><br/>
          Each design choice, from concrete interior to removing trees lining the canal, has been made to get the most water to the most people with the least waste. 
          A worthy goal, but subject to an engineer's nearsightedness: optimize your instrument, at the expense of the larger system.
          <br/><br/> <span className='emphasis'>Our canal could be more beautiful, its true</span>. If the rules are redesigned responsibly, Phoenicians will get what they want: <span className='emphasis'>a vibrant urban canal</span>. <br/><br/> 
          Remember the threshold barrier to change: our city does not own the canal, so we must set policy on its boundaries. <br/><br/> 
          Moreover, the canal's purpose is paramount to our aesthetic complaints: the utility must be able to safely work with the canal.
